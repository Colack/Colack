## About Me

I'm Jack Spencer, a passionate developer committed to creating practical applications that enhance productivity and streamline workflows. I hold a firm belief in the open source community and environment as it provides opportunity for more diverse input; creating a better world for future generations.

<br>

Experiences I have, are journeys such as being the *current* president of [Hanford High School's](https://hanford.rsd.edu/) programming club, which has given me opportunities for leadership, mentoring new programmers, and working on maintaining a positive environment for programmers of all levels, whether beginner or expert.

## Experience

My experience as a self-taught developer has spanned across 8 years. Leading me to develop many skills, through trial and error, and working on projects for a diverse group of people. I have capability and experience in all levels of development, leading to me having a full-stack skills. 

This would be represented by my frontend skills, such as designing and developing websites and web-applications. My backend skills help with creating software servers and robots for social media. I also am able to work on middleware, such as infastructure, API routes, and data management.

The way that I interpret new information when it comes to learning new skills grants me the ability to aquire new skills very rapidly. I have spent major amounts of time and resources doing in-person courses, online classes, and reading college level material related to programming, all to improve my skills as a developer.

## Current Projects

#### [WatermelonKatana](https://github.com/dragonfiregames/watermelonkatana)
A open-source website made for brand new developers wanting a open environment to publish their games.

#### [CubeDood: ReCubed](https://github.com/hhs-coding-club/recubed)
The long awaited reboot to the CubeDood series.

## Technical Skills

- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C, C++, C#, Ruby, Rust, HTML5, CSS3
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Node.js, various frontend libraries as necessary.
- **Development Tools**: Git, Bash scripting, and Linux (Debian & Arch Based).

## Development Environment

With my usage of multiple Operating Systems, I still tend to lean towards linux environments, specifically **Garuda Linux**, an Arch-based Linux environment, as its powerful command-line tools and package management system helps make programming more efficient for me. I also appreciate the open source and free desktop environments.
