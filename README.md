C & C++ are my preferred languages, as I have the most experience with them.   
Github Copilot should be free for everyone as it is based off of most open source repositories.

I'm currently working on updating old code and reviving old projects.   
Here is what I'm working on:
- [ ] Makima V0.3-Windows-C
- [ ] Makima V0.1-Windows-C++
- [ ] Website Update (You can visit the beta [here](https://watermelonkatana.com/new/index).)
- [ ] CubeDood Remastered
- [ ] Bunsen V0.2
- [ ] ApplesC, GAF, & ApplesDocs
- [ ] Py-Chat Security Update
- [ ] RecceBoon
- [ ] Orbital Revival
- [ ] BitCity
- [ ] OtherWorld (Possibility. Expect something like otherworld.watermelonkatana.com)
- [ ] Message-Filter V1.1
- [ ] SATQTSTC Trilogy
- [ ] Chronicles of the Elemental Blades
- [ ] Studio Fighters!
- [ ] CodeHS Answer Repo Re-Write

List is in no particular order. I have no dates for anything on the list. I'm just going to be working on most of these as I want, so expect updates to be rare and random.
